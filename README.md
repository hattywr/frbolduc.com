# Buldoc-Reader-New
An online repository for the access of audio and video recordings, images, and source documents. Meant as additional content for a published biography (Father Hector Bolduc on Amazon) 

Project is powered by Azure - both in the hosting of the site as well as the storage of the actual audio, video, image, and source content - I am using Azure BLOB storage. 
The Blobs are streamed down and a url to each blob is constructed and entered into a text file - I am taking advantage of built in HTML elements and using the blob source urls as the source for the elements.
My grandfather requested this of me as he was the author of the biography - as such, this was an unpaid project and was done as quickly as possible. The site is continuously being updated and adjusted
